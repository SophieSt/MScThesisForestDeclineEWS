As described above, the Mediterranean is a vulnerable ecosystem. In particular Spain is described as at the risk of desertification. The DeBosCat network in Catalonia, northern Spain, is a unique network for the assessment of forest health with field data describing different aspects related to tree mortality. The region was hit by severe droughts in the years 2012 and 2016 resulting in high mortality rates, affecting broadleaved species in particular \citep{chaparro2017}. Catalonia is widely forested (around 40\% of its territory according to MCSC Land Cover Map from 2009) and offers a variety of landscapes and climates due to the presence of the Pyrenees in the North and the proximity to the Mediterranean Sea in the Southeast and the Central Depressions and smaller mountain ranges. Climatically it is classified into Alpine climate in the Pyrenees, Maritime or Oceanic in the valleys and Mediterranean on the coast and the inlands. It is thus diverese and features different kind of climatic and environmental conditions for the vegetation. The forests are managed, though small-scale.\\
