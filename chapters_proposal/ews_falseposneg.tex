\begin{itemize}
	\item How to narrow False Positives and False Negatives?
	\item False Positives hopefully by the choice of the right data and EWS. this is part of RQ3 (?)
	\item False Negatives may occur due to:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item large process errors
		\item large observation errors
		\item multiple noise effects
		\item rapid approach to the critical transition
		\item muffling
		\item higher order terms
		\item fluctuating environments
		\item measureing the wrong variable
		\item non-local bifurcations
		\item non-stationary conditions
		\item interference with spatial processed
		\item too-infrequent observations or too short a time series
	\end{enumerate}
	\item for eliminating  address a suitable study area, see below
	\item suitable dataset: temporal \& spatial resolution, operation time: MODIS \& Landsat archives
	\item fluctuting environments: for the derival of some EWS, apply detrending to not confuse seasonality with resilience measures
\end{itemize}
